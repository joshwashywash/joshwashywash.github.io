I recently re-watched a [computerphile video](#resources) about a simple way to
avoid stack overflows when using recursive functions. The technique is known as
tail recursion.

Note that there are more idiomatic ways to solve the following problems in
JavaScript and TypeScript using _Array.\*_ methods. You can pretty much do
anything with _Array.reduce_. Also, at the time of this writing, I don't think
Node.js nor Deno support tail recursive calls at all so there's that.

## summing a list of numbers

To sum a list of numbers, you'd loop over the list and add the number to the running total.

### sum non-tail-recursive

A non-tail-recursive function that sums a list of numbers could look like the following:

<Code
	code={sum_non_tail_recursive}
	lang="ts"
	title="sum_non_tail_recursive.ts"
/>

You can see by looking at the call stack when calling the function, this version of `sum` is not tail recursive.

<Code
	code={sum_non_tail_recursive_example}
	lang="ts"
	title="sum_non_tail_recursive_example.ts"
/>

A triangular shape forms because the "work" isn't completed until the
recursion has ended. Sometimes the triangle becomes so big that it can't
all fit on the stack. This is what's known as a [stack overflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_overflow).

### sum tail-recursive

A tail-recursive implementation of `sum` might look like this:

<Code
	code={sum_tail_recursive}
	lang="ts"
	title="sum_tail_recursive.ts"
/>

When looking at the call stack, notice how the running total is carried along to the next call of `sum`. This is pretty characteristic of tail recursive functions.

<Code
	code={sum_tail_recursive_example}
	lang="ts"
	title="sum_tail_recursive_example.ts"
/>

## count occurrences in a list

To count the number of times an element appears in a list, loop over the list and check if the current element is equal to the target element. If they are equal, add 1 to the tally otherwise add 0.

### count non-tail-recursive

<Code
	code={count_non_tail_recursive}
	lang="ts"
	title="count_non_tail_recursive.ts"
/>

Again, the "work" is delayed until the recursion is done.

<Code
	code={count_non_tail_recursive_example}
	lang="ts"
	title="count_non_tail_recursive_example.ts"
/>

### count tail-recursive

In the tail-recursive version, the count is passed along to each recursive call.

<Code
	code={count_tail_recursive}
	lang="ts"
	title="count_tail_recursive.ts"
/>

Just like the tail-recursive version of the _sum_ function above, the
calculation is performed before the recursion and the accumulated result gets passed along.

<Code
	code={count_tail_recursive_example}
	lang="ts"
	title="count_tail_recursive_example.ts"
/>

## summary

While writing this post I realized that this style of recursion is a lot like
performing a while loop. In a while loop all the work is done in the body of the
loop and when you're done, you jump back to the top of the loop to do it all
again.
