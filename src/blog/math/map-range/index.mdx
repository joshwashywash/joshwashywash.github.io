This problem comes up in various math and computer science topics. For example,
let's say you're working with frequency data of a song. Each sample is a value
that fits into a byte and ranges from 0 to 255. The range in interval notation
would be written _[0, 255]_. You want to take a sample and map it to the range
_[-1, 1]_. The _[-1, 1]_ range is actually pretty common and can be found in such
fields as graphics programming and trigonometry.

This is a bit of a contrived example but nevertheless the goal is to map a
number in the range _[0, 255]_ to a number in the range _[-1, 1]_. We want the
mapping to be proportionate such that 0 maps to -1, 255 maps to 1, and
everything in-between maps linearly. We're looking for a formula for such a
transformation from any input range to any output range, in other words, from
the range _[a, b]_ to the range _[c, d]_.

## translate to the origin

The first step is to slide the input range so that the low-end starts at 0. This
isn't needed in the example above since the low end of input range is already 0
,but it's a step that can't be skipped. It'll become clear in the next steps why
this translation needs to come first.

The range _[a, b]_ maps to the range _[a - a, b - a]_ equals _[0, b - a]_. From
the example in the opening, _[0, 255]_ becomes _[0 - 0, 255 - 0]_.

## normalize

The next step is to normalize to the range _[0, 1]_. This can be achieved by
dividing by the difference between _b_ and _a_. This will map the range _[0, b]_
to the range _[0 / (b - a), b / (b - a)]_ or _[0, b / (b - a)]_.

A consequence of this is that _a_ and _b_ must not be the same because _b - a_
would equal 0, and you'd be dividing by 0. If one we're dealing with such a
range, You'd only be mapping one number to a range, and it would be ambiguous
where in the range that number would fall. The range _[a, b]_ where b = a is the
same as _[a, a]_ which is just the number _a_. Does _a_ get mapped to the low
end, the high end, or somewhere in-between? There's no _b_ to determine where _a_
should map to.

Following along, the range _[0, 255]_ maps to _[0 / (255 - 0), 255 / (255 - 0)]_
or _[0, 1]_.

## scale to output range

Normalizing in the previous step got us to the range _[0, 1]_. We kinda do the
inverse of the first two steps to get to the range _[c, d]_. First we scale by
_d - c_. Since the range right now is normalized, this operation won't affect
the lower end of the range. We go from the range _[0, 1]_ to the range _[0 *
(d - c), 1 * (d - c)]_ or _[0, d - c]_.

Following the example, _[0, 1]_ goes to _[0 * (1 - (-1)), 1 * (1 - (-1))]_
equals _[0 * 2, 1 * 2]_ equals _[0, 2]_.

## translate to the start of the output range

The final step is to map from _[0, d - c]_ to _[c, d]_. Here all we need to do
is add _c_. _[0 + c, d - c + c]_ equals _[c, d]_.

From the example, _[0, 2]_ maps to _[0 + (-1), 2 + (-1)]_ equals _[-1, 1]_.

## combining it all into a function

The four steps above can be written as a single function.

<Code
	code={map_code}
	lang="ts"
	title="map.ts"
/>

In practice, solving the problem from the beginning of the post would look like
the following.

<Code
	code={example_code}
	lang="ts"
	title="example.ts"
/>

## all done

`map` is a really simple function, but it's not one that can easily be understood
unless you think about it geometrically. I first saw this function when I used
to program on the Arduino way back when. It never really clicked for me until I
started graphics programming and thought about it visually. Mapping between
different coordinate systems is a very common activity in graphics. I guess that
goes to show how ubiquitous `map` is.
